	\begin{frame}{Why go?}
		In 2007, three guys at Google were frustrated with the existing languages for writing server software:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Compiling C++ was too slow
			\item Writing Java felt too verbose
			\item Aversion against inheritance and design patterns
			\item Getting concurrency right was hard
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

		\begin{minted}{cpp}
// Within large projects, popular header files
// get included thousands of times and hence
// have to be recompiled over and over again
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
		\end{minted}
		\pause
		\texttt{gcc} copies specified file by \mintinline{cpp}{#include} recursively into source file. The \textit{same} header file gets recompiled over and over again.\\

		Initial design by 3 people with different backgrounds:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Rob Pike (Concurrency)
			\item Robert Griesemer (Modules)
			\item Ken Thompson (Operating Systems)
		\end{itemize}
		All design decisions had to be agreed upon unanimously.
		Design team later joined by more people at Google.
